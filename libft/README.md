# libft @ 42

This is the first 42 project. The task is to recreate various standard C
library functions, as well as extra things which might be useful, like linked
lists for example.

## Compiling
You may compile `libft.a` by running `make`.

## Documentation
They should behave more or less the same as their standard C library
counterparts. However, I have started documenting all of my libft for good
measure. Some functions lack documentation, but they should be pretty
straightforward to understand just by reading the code.

## Usage
Include it in your C project:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```
